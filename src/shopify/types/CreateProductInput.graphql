    handle: String
    # A unique, human-readable string that's used to identify the product in URLs. A handle can contain letters, hyphens (-), and numbers, but no spaces. If no handle is explicitly provided, then the title is used to construct the product's handle. For example, if a product is titled "Black Sunglasses" and no handle is provided, then the handle black-sunglasses is generated (unless that handle is already taken, in which case a suffix is added to make the handle unique).
