For Brian and Janet Smith, it was the start of a simpler and healthier way of life. They gleaned so much knowledge from their friends and neighbors that it was only a matter of time before Granny Smith Natural Products was born.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTogether with their five daughters, the Smiths learned important tasks such as raising hens, selling eggs, gardening, preserving foods, cheese-making, tending bees, and more. They took their knowledge and products to local fairs and stores and the rest is history.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGranny Smith products are made with only nourishing and soothing ingredients such as shea butter, coconut oil, beeswax, and vitamin E oil. They guarantee that you will be satisfied with their natural soaps and skin care products.</p>",
