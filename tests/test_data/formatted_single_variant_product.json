    "Body (HTML)": "<h4>From Hummingbird Wholesale</h4><p>Generally thought of as a grain, Amaranth is actually a seed that was used as a staple food of the Aztecs and Incas.</p><p>Amaranth has one of the highest protein contents of all the grains, and is a good source of calcium, fiber and iron. This naturally gluten-free grain is also packed with lysine, an essential amino acid that helps build muscles and absorb calcium.</p><p>Amaranth has a mild, nutty slightly sweet flavor, and tastes delicious when combined with other grains such as rice or buckwheat.</p><p>Use it as a hearty, nutty-flavored breakfast cereal or cooked with your favorite herbs for a tasty side dish to round out any meal. It also works great as a replacement for polenta in layered dishes.</p><p>Directions for use:</p><p>Cook 3 parts water to 1 part grain for approximately 20 - 30 minutes on medium heat.</p><p>When combining with other grains, use a 1 to 3 part ratio; 1 part Amaranth to 3 parts total grain.</p><table style=\"width: 333px;\"><tbody><tr style=\"height: 36px;\"><td style=\"width: 169px; height: 36px;\"><p>Origin</p></td><td style=\"width: 707px; height: 36px;\"><p>India</p></td></tr><tr style=\"height: 36px;\"><td style=\"width: 169px; height: 36px;\"><p>Storage Info</p></td><td style=\"width: 707px; height: 36px;\"><p>Store in a cool, dark, dry place</p></td></tr><tr style=\"height: 36px;\"><td style=\"width: 169px; height: 36px;\"><p>Shelf Life</p></td><td style=\"width: 707px; height: 36px;\"><p>1 year of Julian date</p></td></tr><tr style=\"height: 36px;\"><td style=\"width: 169px; height: 36px;\"><p>Ingredients</p></td><td style=\"width: 707px; height: 36px;\"><p>Organic Whole Grain Amaranth</p></td></tr><tr style=\"height: 36px;\"><td style=\"width: 169px; height: 36px;\"><p>Allergens</p></td><td style=\"width: 707px; height: 36px;\"><p>None</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",
